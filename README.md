# ABFEP input structures and results
A set of input structures for validation of ABFEP and spreadsheets containing the results.
## Contents
### `InputFiles_ABFEP/`
Input structures for ABFEP calculations, including two sets: one for the congeneric compound series for eight proteins (`InputFiles_ABFEP/Congeneric_8proteins_ABFEP`), and the other for the virtual screening of JAK2 (`InputFiles_ABFEP/JAK2_VS_ABFEP`).
### `Results_ABFEP/`
Results of ABFEP calculations: one spreadsheet for the congeneric compound series for eight proteins (`Results_ABFEP/Congeneric_8proteins_ABFEP.xlsx`), and the other for the virtual screening of JAK2 (`Results_ABFEP/JAK2_VS_ABFEP.xlsx`).

### abfep_sub.sh
The shell script to submit ABFEP simulations with input structures in InputFiles_ABFEP by using the FEP+ program in the Schrodinger Suite.
